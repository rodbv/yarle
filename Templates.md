# How to use templates with YARLE

You can control the Markdown output generated by YARLE by using templates like the one below, which is similar to YARLE's default template:

```
{title-block}# {title}{end-title-block}

{tags-block}
---
Tag(s): {tags}

---
{end-tags-block}

{content-block}{content}{end-content-block}

{metadata-block}
    {created-at-block}    Created at: {created-at}{end-created-at-block}
    {updated-at-block}    Updated at: {updated-at}{end-updated-at-block}
    {location-block}    Where: {location}{end-location-block}
{end-metadata-block}
```

To provide a template to YARLE just pass it as a parameter, e.g `--template ../path/to/template.md`. You can use any file name/extension you want.

A template has two basic elements, a "block" tag which encloses the type of content it will produce, and also the formatting you want around it (e.g. `#` for a header, or `---` for a separator), and the content tag itself such as `{tags}` and `{content}`. Every content tag must have its block surrounding it.

If you suppress any of the blocks, it will be skipped altogether, for example if you want to have Markdown files with just the title and the main content, and you could use a template such as

```
{title-block}# {title}{end-title-block}

{content-block}{content}{end-content-block}
```

Have fun! ðŸ˜ƒ
